# Code Review

in docs or in .ai you'll find our coding standards after reading them we need to code review all the changes in this branch (all of them) and make sure we are compliant, after that provide a detailed code review of the changes.

Keep analysis concise and actionable.

Focus Areas:

Strengths: What's working well
Weaknesses: Key issues or gaps
Improvements: Top 2-3 actionable recommendations
Keep output brief and strategic. Avoid detailed explanations unless critical
