Spawn parallel agents to reade readme.md, .ai/ folder content to familiarize yourself with the project goals, status and tasks remaining,
Then spawn subagents to examine the codebase to familiarize yourself with patterns and how everything is structured, not write any code or try to change anything, just read and take it in.
Eventually we'll want to do $ARGUMENTS, but for now the most important thing is to focus in learning the repository
